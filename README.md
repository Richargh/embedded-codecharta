# Embedded CodeCharta

CodeCharta is embedded as an iframe in the [index.html](index.html). 
Which map is displayed can be changed via three buttons.
* JUnit4 2018 opens the metrics map from 2018
* JUnit4 2019 opens the metrics map from 2019
* JUnit4 2018&2019 opens the metrics maps from 2018 and 2019. However only the first map is selected. By hand you can now select "Delta" and compare 2019 to 2018.

## Usage
